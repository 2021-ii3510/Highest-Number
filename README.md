# Highest Number

This is the application that we have developed during the first lecture.

I have made a few changes to it, namely:

- I have added comments to explain some parts of the code;
- I have added comments to explain the overall logic of a method;
- I have refactored some lines to make it easier to read.

Feel free to clone this project, and play around with it.
