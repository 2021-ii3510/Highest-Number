# Highest Number

This is the application that we have developed during the first lecture.

I have made a few changes to it, namely:

- I have added comments to explain some parts of the code;
- I have added comments to explain the overall logic of a method;
- I have refactored some lines to make it easier to read;
- I have refactored the application to have a nicer UI (especially with the height of the second `LinearLayout`).

Feel free to clone this project, and play around with it.
